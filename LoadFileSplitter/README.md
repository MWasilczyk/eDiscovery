# Load-File-Splitter
==========

###Goal: 

Create a Python script to split an eDiscovery database load file into several smaller portions, while maintaining header information.

### Current parameters:

* Original load file name  
* Desired number of non-header lines per new file  
* Desired prefix for new filenames  
* Desired extension for new files 
* Input checks to verify extension length and number of lines as integer.
	
### Planned features:

* Input checks to verify initial load file, filename length 
* Select directory for original load file / new files.  

### Notes: 

This is my first scripting project, designed to both fill a need and serve as an introductory/learning exercise in Python. I am sure there are many similar/better projects out there, but I would welcome feedback tailored towards someone with only a cursory knowledge of scripting.
